Write down a simple web application using only JavaScript ( or Angular ) that will:

- Retrieve a list of countries from the API at **http://universities.hipolabs.com/search**.
- Create a dropdown menu labeled "COUNTRY" containing all available countries. The displayed list of universities will be filtered based on the selected country.
- Include an input field labeled "NAME" that filters the displayed list to show only universities matching the input value, regardless of case sensitivity.
- Clearing the "NAME" input should update the list accordingly.
- If both "NAME" and "COUNTRY" are selected, consider both filters when displaying the list.
- Provide a clear button to reset the list.
- Show a list of universities that meet both the selected country and name criteria, displaying the first 10 matches. The displayed universities should be filtered based on the name.

filtered -> sorted?
